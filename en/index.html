          <h2>Fox</h2>
          <p>Foxes are omnivorous mammals belonging to the Canidae family. They are medium-sized canids, characterized by a long snout and a long, bushy tail. One of their most remarkable abilities is their exceptional hearing - they can hear a mouse moving under snow.</p>
          <p>They also have distinctive oval pupils, similar to the vertical pupils of felines. These special pupils allow them excellent night vision for hunting.</p>
          <p>Of about 40 species recognized as foxes, only 12 belong to the Vulpes genus of "true foxes," of which the red fox is the most common. Amazingly, foxes are the only mammals capable of detecting Earth's magnetic field for hunting.</p>
          <p>Foxes are very social animals with a unique "language," using over 40 different sounds to communicate with each other.</p>

          <h2>Squirrel</h2>
          <p>Squirrels are small rodent mammals characterized by their long, bushy tail and sharp claws. There are over 200 species worldwide, perfectly adapted for arboreal life.</p>
          <p>One of the most impressive abilities of squirrels is their memory. A single squirrel can hide up to 10,000 acorns and seeds and remember precisely where each one is located.</p>
          <p>Their front teeth grow continuously throughout their lives and are perfectly adapted for cracking hard shells and nuts. Interestingly, squirrels are among the few animals with a clear hand preference - right-handed or left-handed.</p>
          <p>Squirrels are very intelligent animals with complex problem-solving abilities, and they can distinguish between different human faces. Their tail also serves as a tool for emotional expression.</p>

          <h2>Bear</h2>
          <p>Bears are large mammals from the Ursidae family, with 8 species currently existing. They have excellent smell, 7 times more sensitive than humans, and can detect odors from several kilometers away.</p>
          <p>Little-known fact: bears are excellent swimmers capable of swimming at 10 km/h. Additionally, they can run up to 50 km/h, faster than a horse.</p>
          <p>During hibernation, bears demonstrate extraordinary abilities. They spend 5-7 months without eating, urinating, or defecating, and don't lose muscle mass or bone density.</p>
          <p>Bears are very intelligent animals capable of using tools. Each bear has a unique "voice print," and mother bears can recognize their cubs' calls from hundreds of meters away.</p>

          <h2>Wolf</h2>
          <p>Wolves are the largest animals in the Canidae family and ancestors of all dog breeds. They live in a complex social structure called a pack, led by an alpha pair.</p>
          <p>Wolf howling isn't just sound, but a complex communication method including information about location, individual identification, and emotional state. Howling can be heard up to 16 kilometers away.</p>
          <p>Their bite force is 150 kg per cm², allowing them to take down large prey. They're also excellent runners capable of traveling up to 70 kilometers per day.</p>
          <p>Wolves are considered a "keystone species" in ecosystems, their presence being vital for maintaining environmental balance. Amazingly, wolves can express complex emotions like sadness and joy.</p>

          <h2>Monkey</h2>
          <p>Monkeys belong to the primate order and number over 260 species worldwide. They possess high intelligence and complex sociality, living in elaborate social structures. Tool use and cultural transmission have been observed in them.</p>
          <p>Many monkey species have self-recognition ability, like humans, and can recognize themselves in a mirror. They also understand basic mathematical concepts and can perform simple calculations.</p>
          <p>Monkeys' communication abilities are very advanced - some species use over 100 different sounds and gestures to communicate. Some species can even learn human sign language.</p>
          <p>Interestingly, monkeys have a "dominant hand" like humans, with this preference varying between individuals and species. They also value emotional bonds and have been observed mourning the death of their companions.</p>

          <h2>Lion</h2>
          <p>Lions are the only feline species living in groups, known as the "king of beasts." They dominate African savannas and live in groups called prides, which can include up to 30 individuals.</p>
          <p>The male's emblematic mane darkens with age and serves both as female attraction and intimidation of other males. A darker mane indicates higher testosterone levels.</p>
          <p>A lion's roar can be heard 8 kilometers away and reaches 114 decibels - equivalent to an airplane engine noise.</p>
          <p>Surprisingly, lions rest 20 hours per day, and hunting is mainly done at night. Lionesses are primarily responsible for hunting and use sophisticated teamwork to take down large prey. Lions can swim but tend to avoid water.</p>
